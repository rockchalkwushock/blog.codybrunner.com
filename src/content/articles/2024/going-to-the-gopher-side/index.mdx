description: The chaos that is the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem has become too much to bear in my opinion. I have become unhappy with my direction in the tech industry and in late 2023 made the decision to begin teaching myself Go and pivoting my career out of the Frontend & away from JavaScript.

## Introduction

If I had a penny for how many times I have been told that I would be able to move into a more full stack or even backend role after accepting a Frontend position...I would have a lot of pennies. After five years of working pretty much exclusively on the frontend and in the JavaScript ecosystem I am over it. I want out. I want to solve _actual_ problems, not write the same UI with a different iteration of the same bloated JS frameworks that make me want to hang myself (in ASCII art).

In years past I have experimented with Elixir and I do love the language as well as Phoenix and Phoenix Liveview. So why not double down on Elixir? Albeit the hype around Elixir has definitely grown a lot and that's reflected by the [](). The problem still remains that their are not many job openings that hire for new developers in that space. I am sure people will argue that it's no different for Go, but I am bullish on this language due to how prevalent it's usage is in DevOps and tooling. Hell just in the JS ecosystem you can find tools like [esbuild]() that were written in Go. Things like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), [tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), & [traefik](https://traefik.io/) are all written in Go as well. My decision ultimately came down to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) or [Go](https://go.dev) and I decided that it would be faster and more beneficial to my career to learn Go. Cue the screams of the Rust Andies with "Well Akschully!"

## So why choose Go?

Go has a great community around it and the tooling is phenomenal. It won't take you long in a chatroom before you will here someone say:

> Have you tried the using the Standard Library?

Coming from the JavaScript ecosystem where I need to install 80 dependencies to even get started it is a breath of fresh air to seldom ever need to import packages.

Go is easy to install an get started with. It compiles your program down to binary that can be ran on any system. I love Elixir and I have found ways to get around certain problems with Erlang and macOS, but man it's a pain in the ass to fight version issues with Elixir and Erlang.

One thing I noticed coming from TypeScript is just how fast Go is when it comes to analyzing my code and telling me their are problems. The type inference is next level.

## Wrap Up

I have come to really really love programming in Go. My love of programming is back and that is amazing after the last year or two of hating what I do. I still am writing UI and JavaScript in my day job, but I am actively working in Go in my spare time.

In the coming weeks and months most of this blog, at least when it comes to tech, will be on my progress and projects around Go. There will still be sprinklings of React, Astro, etc, but definitely plan on reading more about Go.
