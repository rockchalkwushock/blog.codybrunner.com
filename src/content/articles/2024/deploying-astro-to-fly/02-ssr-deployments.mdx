## Introduction

In part one of the series we covered how to deploy static Astro projects to [fly.io](https://fly.io). Here in part two we will cover how to deploy server-side rendered Astro projects, and it's just as easy if not easier!

## Updating our Astro Project for SSR

```bash
pnpm astro add node
```

```diff title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import node from '@astrojs/node';

export default defineConfig({
+ adapter: node({
+   mode: 'standalone',
+ }),
+ output: 'server',
+ server: {
+   port: 3000,
+ },
  site: "https://astro-project.fly.dev",
});
```

## Updating Docker & Fly Configurations

We are basically going to revert what we did to both files. Like I mentioned before this is actually easier than the static deployment.

```diff title="Dockerfile"
# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1

# Adjust NODE_VERSION as desired
ARG NODE_VERSION=20.9.0
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim as base

LABEL fly_launch_runtime="Node.js"

# Node.js app lives here
WORKDIR /app

# Set production environment
ENV NODE_ENV="production"

# Install pnpm
ARG PNPM_VERSION=8.10.5
RUN npm install -g pnpm@$PNPM_VERSION

# Throw-away build stage to reduce size of final image
FROM base as build

# Install packages needed to build node modules
- RUN apt-get update -qq && \
- apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config python-is-python3
+ RUN apt-get update -qq && \
+ apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential node-gyp pkg-config python-is-python3


# Install node modules
COPY --link package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod=false

# Copy application code
COPY --link . .

# Build application
RUN pnpm run build

# Remove development dependencies
RUN pnpm prune --prod

# Final stage for app image
- FROM pierrezemb/gostatic
+ FROM base

# Copy built application
- COPY --from=build /app/dist /srv/http
+ COPY --from=build /app /app

# Start the server by default, this can be overwritten at runtime
+ EXPOSE 3000

+ CMD [ "pnpm", "run", "start" ]
```

```diff title="fly.toml"
# fly.toml app configuration file generated for astro-project on 2024-01-07T13:23:32-05:00
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.

	cpus = 1
	memory_mb = 1024
```

One last thing we will need to do before we can deploy is update our `start` script in the `package.json`. When we run `pnpm build` their will be a `dist/` that is output by Astro. In this directory you should find another directory called `server/` with an `entry.mjs` file inside of it. This is the file that we will need to tell Docker to execute on Fly's servers.

```diff title="package.json"
{
   "name": "astro-project",
   "type": "module",
   "version": "0.0.1",
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "astro dev",
-    "start": "astro dev",
+     "start": "HOST=0.0.0.0 node ./dist/server/entry.mjs",
     "build": "astro check && astro build",
     "preview": "astro preview",
     "astro": "astro"
   },
   "dependencies": {
     "@astrojs/check": "~0.3.4",
     "@astrojs/node": "7.0.4",
     "astro": "^4.1.1",
     "typescript": "~5.3.3"
   },
   "devDependencies": {
     "@flydotio/dockerfile": "~0.5.0"
   }
 }
```

> **NOTE**: Please note the addition of `HOST=0.0.0.0` to the command. This is necessary as when we start the server Astro believes it is running locally so we end up with 127.0.0.1:3000. This is fine on your and my machine but on Fly this will not...fly...hahaha!

And with that we can run `fly deploy` and wait to visit our updated Astro project that is not server-side rendered.
