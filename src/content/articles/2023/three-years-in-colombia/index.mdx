## Introduction

It is very hard to beleive that it has been three years since I boarded a one-way flight from the USA to Colombia. The world was a very different place at that time with COVID-19 still having most of the world under pandemic measures.

## Where I Have Been

In the time I have lived here in Colombia I cannot say that I have done much traveling. The first six months most of the country was still under restrictions due to the pandemic. After that it was time for applying for a visa and the unbelievable amount of stress that comes with that.

## What Has Happened

## Where I Am Going

At this time I will be moving...yet again.
