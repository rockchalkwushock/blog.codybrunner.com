## Introduction

It is very hard to beleive that it has been over three years since I boarded a one-way flight from the USA to Colombia. The world was a very different place at that time with COVID-19 still having most of the world under pandemic measures.

## Where I Have Been

In the time I have lived here in Colombia I cannot say that I have done much traveling. The first six months most of the country was still under restrictions due to the pandemic. After that it was time for applying for a visa and the unbelievable amount of stress that comes with that.

## What Has Happened

### Carbon monoxide is one hell of a drug

### Taxes & the DIAN

### Saying Goodbye to Tommie

In August of 2023 my wife and I were blindsided by the unthinkable. Our beloved dog Tommie began getting sick. It was one week from the time we knew he had a mass to the day we said goodbye to him. He was only 8 years old and had been with my wife since he was a puppy. He was a very special dog and we miss him every day. We had Tommie cremated and in November my wife traveled to San Andrés and I to the summit of Nevado del Tolima to spread his ashes. Mommy and I miss you more than you will ever know Tommie. Rest in peace pretty boy.

## Where I Am Going

My wife and I still call Chía home for now. We are considering our options for leaving Colombia and moving to another country. We are not sure where that will be yet but we are looking at several options. We are also considering moving to another city in Colombia. We are not sure what the future holds for us but we are excited to see what happens.

## Conclusion

Although I am not certain if Colombia will grant me residency or not and I cannot say for certain that I will stay in Colombia if they do not grant me residency. I can say there will be fond memories of my time here. I will miss the food and the culture. I will miss the mountains and the weather. I will miss the people and the places. I will miss the good and the bad. I will miss Colombia.
