## Introduction

There are times when we want to be able to not think about deploying our applications and services like Cloudflare Pages have direct integrations with GitHub to automagically deploy our applications when we push to a specific branch. That is great and all but what if we want more fine grained control over that process? What if we only want a deployment to happen if other steps in our CI succeed (i.e. linting, test, etc)? In this post we will look at how to deploy a [Qwik-City](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/qwikcity/) project to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) via our own workflow on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Getting what we need from Cloudflare

If you do not have a Cloudflare account you can sign up for one [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up). Once you have an account we can create our API token. Find the `"My Profile"` tab in the top right corner of the dashboard and click on it. Then click on `"API Tokens"` in the left column. Then click on `"Create Token"` in the right column.

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of the Cloudflare API Tokens Dashboard.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image1}
	width={800}
/>

At the bottom of the `"Create Token"` page you will find a `"Custom Token"` option. That is what we will need to choose to programmatically deploy to Cloudflare Pages from GitHub Actions.

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of the Cloudflare API Tokens Dashboard for creating a custom token.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image2}
	width={800}
/>

Name your token and give it the following permissions:

1. Account
2. Cloudflare Pages
3. Edit

> If you have multiple accounts and want to scope this token to a specific account you can do that here as well. Select the account you want to scope the token too in the `"Account Resources"` section.

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of creating a custom token.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image3}
	width={800}
/>

After you have your API token we need to setup a Direct Upload project via the Cloudflare Pages Dashboard. Whatever you name your project will be what we use for the `projectName` in the GitHub Actions workflow.

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of the Cloudflare Workers & Pages Overview Dashboard.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image4}
	width={800}
/>

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of creating a new Direct Upload project with Cloudflare Pages.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image5}
	width={800}
/>

Once the project has been created we can now navigate back to the Cloudflare Workers & Pages Overview Dashboard and retrieve our Cloudflare Account ID. You will find it in the right hand column of the overview dashboard. This will be used in the GitHub Actions workflow.

We should now have the three things we need from Cloudflare:

- Cloudflare Account ID
- Cloudflare API Token
- Cloudflare Pages Project Name

---

## Setting up GitHub

If you do not have a GitHub account you can sign up for one [here](https://github.com/signup). We can now create a new repository [here](https://github.com/new). It should be an empty repository with no README, .gitignore, or license. You will be dropped off at a screen like the one below. Make sure you copy the following commands to use locally:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
git push -u origin production # this will be "main"
```

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of empty GitHub repository page with commands.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image6}
	width={800}
/>

Once the repository has been created we can add the following secrets to the repository:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

To do that we will need to go to:

```
Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions > New repository secret
```

<Image
	alt='Screenshot of the GitHub repository settings page for adding new repository secrets.'
	class='object-cover'
	fetchpriority='low'
	height={300}
	quality={100}
	src={image7}
	width={800}
/>

## Setting up Qwik City

We can now create a new `qwik-city` project:

```shell
pnpm create qwik@latest
```

Select the basic app option that will give us a wokring template with `qwik-city` integrated into it. Once the project has been created we can add the Cloudflare Pages integration:

```shell
pnpm run qwik add cloudflare-pages
```

{/* TODO: Talk about the items added by the integration. */}

## Setting up GitHub Actions

To add GitHub Actions to our repository we will need to create a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory called `publish.yml`. We can then add the following workflow to the file:

```shell
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

Cloudflare actually has and maintains there own GitHub Action for deploying to Cloudflare Pages. We will be using that in our workflow. You can find the GitHub Action [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cloudflare-pages-github-action).

```yml showLineNumbers title=".github/workflows/publish.yml"
name: Publish

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - production # this will be "main"
      - staging # development branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - staging
    types:
      - edited
      - opened
      - synchronize

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish to Cloudflare Pages
    # This is very important don't miss it!
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
        pnpm-version: [8.x]
    timeout-minutes: 10

    steps:
      - uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.11.0
        with:
          access_token: ${{ github.token }}

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2.2.4
        with:
          version: ${{ matrix.pnpm-version }}

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          cache: 'pnpm'
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm run build
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production

      - uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1.5.0
        with:
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          directory: dist
          gitHubToken: ${{ github.token }}
          projectName: qwik-blog-test # your project name
```

## Pushing to GitHub

We can now add the GitHub remotes and push to GitHub:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
git push -u origin production # this will be "main"
```

After pushing to GitHub we can either navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the `"Actions"` tab or we can navigate to our Cloudflare Pages Dashboard and see the deployment in progress. Once the deployment has finished we can click on the `"Visit Site"` button in the Cloudflare Pages Dashboard to see our application live.

## Wrap Up

We have now successfully deployed a Qwik-City application to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub Actions.
