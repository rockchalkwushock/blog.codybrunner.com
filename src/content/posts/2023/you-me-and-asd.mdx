description: In 2020 my wife began to suspect she was on the autism spectrum. Although she has opted to not pursue a clinical diagnosis several psychiatrists have said she scores very high on their tests for ASD and likely would have been categorized with Aspergers in the past. This is a post about the challenges she has faced and continues to face as well as those of our marriage as a neurodivergent/neurotypical couple.
